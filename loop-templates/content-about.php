		<div class="desc">Wondering how American Cakes ended up in Antwerp, Belgium? Well that’s an
			easy answer!I left California to study for my masters and in the meantime I fell in love
			with a Belgian . So now my baking is here to stay... but everyone who’s tried my cakes
			seems pretty happy about that.
